## Development server

To start a local development server

Start by cloning this repository to your local machine:
```bash
https://github.com/jithin-raj449/ZuperDemo.git
```
Navigate into the project directory:
`cd ZuperDemo`

Install all the necessary dependencies for the project:
```bash
npm install
```
This will install the dependencies specified in package.json and set up your project for development.


To start the application locally, run the following command:
```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
